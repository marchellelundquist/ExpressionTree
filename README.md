# ExpressionTree
Expression tree program written in Java for a class assignment.

This program creates and evaluates expression trees.  ExpressionTree creates ExpressionNode objects which are used in the building of expression trees, then utilizes the MyStack class to create LinkedList-based stacks which allow for the evaluation of the expression trees' postfix and prefix expressions.
